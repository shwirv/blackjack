BlackJackGame

I am learning Python, and I thought piecing together a blackjack game would be a good exercise in object oriented programming.
Don't laugh at my code, even though I'm sure it's laughable.

Actually, laugh away: what's life without humor? :)

Any suggestions are welcome as long as they are constructive and at a level I can understand. I've been coding for 1 month!
